# m8rscript, A new IoT scripting language
> Caution: MaterScript is very much a work in progress. You can do a few things with it, like get the current time and print on Mac. But it's not up on ESP8266 yet and for all I know may never be. Right now it's just a proof of concept. Proceed at your own risk.

See https://github.com/cmarrin/m8rscript/wiki for an overview of m8rscript and its features.
