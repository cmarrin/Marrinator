// Telnet interface
//
// Telnet is a symmetric interface, so this isn't really a client or a
// server. It sits between the incoming raw data from the Channel and the
// Client of that data. Data coming in from the Channel is unchanged unless
// it is IAC (0xff), then it is the start of a command. To receive a literal
// 0xff this command must be followed by another 0xff. So the sequence of
// events this class performs is:
//
//  1) If char is not IAC, pass through to Client, exit
//  2) If the next char is 0xff, pass 0xff through to Client, exit
//  3) Enter command mode
//
// Command mode is where all the action is. And example of a command is
// when the user types a ^c on a telnet client. This sends IAC IP.
//
// This class is a line editor. It maintains a line buffer which is
// edited based on input from the Channel. It supports delete, backspace,
// right and left arrow, ctl-a, ctl-e, etc. When a newline is received
// from the Channel, the line buffer is sent to the Client. As the line
// is edited edits are sent back to the Channel to keep the line up to
// date at that end.
